##  Description

For your first project, you'll build a front-end for a Reddit-like application where a user, once logged in, can create a post that will show up on every user’s feed and on which any user can comment.

You'll use what you've learned so far to create a layout using HTML and CSS, along with complex JavaScript to implement logic.

You'll be working **with an assigned partner** for this project.

### Technical Requirements

Students' apps must:

- Have a landing page with a navigation bar.
- Have user login and sign-up (i.e., create HTML forms).
- Have a home page containing all posts.
- Allow a user to create and delete their own posts.
- Allow a user to view comments on other posts.
- Allow a user to create and delete their own comments.
- Allow a user to update their profile information.
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
- Show user-friendly messages in case any errors occur.
- Include separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Stick with the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) and DRY (don't repeat yourself) principles.
- Include semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices).

You can create either a single-page app or multiple HTML pages.

### Necessary Deliverables

- A Git repository hosted on GitHub.
- Around 50 (or more) commits on GitHub, dating back to the beginning of the project. (Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea of what you changed.)
- A `README.md` file with:
  - Explanations of the technologies used.
  - A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took.
  - Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.
  - A link to your planning documentation for how you broke down this project with deliverables and timelines.
  - Installation instructions for any dependencies.
  - A link to your wireframes — sketches of major views or interfaces in your application.

### Stretch Goals
1. Create a responsive layout.
1. The user profile page shows the comments and posts from the logged-in user.
1. Error messages are handled gracefully either as modals or in-line with the HTML.
1. Use [Adorable Avatars](http://avatars.adorable.io) to generate random avatars for each user.
1. Allow the user to change their avatar on their profile page to any public image URL.


### Assessment

Project 1 will be assessed in line with the [standard project guidelines](https://git.generalassemb.ly/GA-Cognizant/amex-projects/blob/master/project-assessment.md).
